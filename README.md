## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

More about flexbox, box-shadow and semantic html5

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>main tag</h1>
I'm trying to use all recomendations to creta a more accesible html. On this
project I used just main, because there are not more areas like section and
footer to explore, but I could review this concept.
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

I spend more time studyng about flexbox, box-shadow and transform properties instead copy someone else solution.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to study and build challenges to fix my understanding about flexbox, grid and semantic html, before use any SaaS or framework

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
