## My process

Because I'm a newbie I started doing everything that I know without copy any solution.
First I start with the mobile version and at the end made the adjusts to desktop and wide, as my monitor is wide.
After I got stuck to align some elements in special to centre the main container found a solution on CSS Tricks (resources at the end), this brought me to learn more about transform property.

Another point was box-shadow that I have never used before only and I spend more time learning before coding the solution.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I review 3 conceps that I got stuck during the challenge:

- flexbox
- box-shadow
- transform

Exploring some online-tutorials I could finish the challenge having a better undertand of them, but I still need practice to be conformtable. But I'm proud to have figure out how to make the box-shadow after the tutorial. Follow bellow the code with comments to explain better each value.

```css
.button-pay {
  /* horizontal (+/-) vertical (+/-) size blur (0 solid-soft) start blur color (default transparent) */
  box-shadow: 0px 20px 20px -2px #c5d0f7;
}
```

I spend more time studyng about flexbox, box-shadow and transform properties instead copy someone else solution.

### Continued development

I want to study and build challenges to fix my understanding about flexbox, grid and semantic html, before use any SaaS or framework

### Useful resources

I was totally in doubt about some concepts these folks here produced good explanations.
